# Superego-LangChain Progress

**Note: The original refactoring plan has been replaced by the new [Focused Improvement Plan](improvement_plan.md).**

This document is kept for historical reference. Please refer to the new improvement plan for the current approach to improving the codebase.

## Completed Work

The following work has been completed so far:

1. **Agent Abstraction & Basic AutoGen Integration**
   - Created an Agent interface with `process()`, `stream()`, and `interrupt()` methods
   - Implemented an AutoGenAgent class using AutoGen 0.4
   - Created a CLI test harness for the AutoGen agent

2. **Input Superego Implementation**
   - Implemented an InputSuperego agent that evaluates user inputs
   - Created a CLI test harness for the InputSuperego agent
   - Integrated the InputSuperego with the AutoGen agent in a SuperegoFlow

3. **Constitution System Upgrade**
   - Refactored the constitution system to use individual markdown files
   - Created a constitution registry that loads from individual files
   - Separated agent instructions from constitutions
   - Created a new directory structure for agent instructions

## Current Architecture

The current architecture is based on the following components:

1. **Agent Interface**: A common interface for all agents with `process()`, `stream()`, and `interrupt()` methods.
2. **AutoGenAgent**: An implementation of the Agent interface using AutoGen 0.4.
3. **InputSuperego**: An implementation of the Agent interface that evaluates user inputs against a constitution.
4. **SuperegoFlow**: A flow that combines the InputSuperego and AutoGen agents to create a complete system.

This foundation will be built upon according to the new [Focused Improvement Plan](improvement_plan.md).
