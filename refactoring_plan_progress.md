# Superego-LangChain Refactoring Progress

## Completed

### MVP 1: Agent Abstraction & Basic AutoGen Integration ✅

- Created an Agent interface with `process()`, `stream()`, and `interrupt()` methods
- Implemented an AutoGenAgent class using AutoGen 0.4
- Created a CLI test harness for the AutoGen agent
- Successfully tested the AutoGen agent with basic queries

### MVP 2: Input Superego Implementation ✅

- Implemented an InputSuperego agent that evaluates user inputs
- Created a CLI test harness for the InputSuperego agent
- Integrated the InputSuperego with the AutoGen agent in a SuperegoFlow
- Successfully tested the SuperegoFlow with the CLI

### MVP 3: Constitution System Upgrade ✅

- Refactored the constitution system to use individual markdown files
- Created a constitution registry that loads from individual files
- Separated agent instructions from constitutions
- Created a new directory structure for agent instructions
- Successfully tested with multiple constitutions

## Next Steps

### MVP 4: Output Superego Implementation

- Implement an OutputSuperego agent that monitors token streams
- Create a basic intervention system
- Update the CLI to show interventions

### MVP 5: Advanced Interventions

- Implement more sophisticated intervention capabilities
- Enhance the intervention system with modify/stop capabilities
- Update the CLI to demonstrate different intervention types

### MVP 6: Flow Architecture

- Implement the complete flow architecture
- Support for different agent configurations
- Update the CLI to switch between flows

### MVP 7: WebSocket Integration

- Update the WebSocket endpoints to work with the new architecture
- Create a frontend compatibility layer
- Enhance message types for new capabilities

## Architecture Overview

The current architecture is based on the following components:

1. **Agent Interface**: A common interface for all agents with `process()`, `stream()`, and `interrupt()` methods.

2. **AutoGenAgent**: An implementation of the Agent interface using AutoGen 0.4.

3. **InputSuperego**: An implementation of the Agent interface that evaluates user inputs against a constitution.

4. **SuperegoFlow**: A flow that combines the InputSuperego and AutoGen agents to create a complete system.

The flow works as follows:

1. User input is received
2. InputSuperego evaluates the input
3. If the input is allowed or cautioned, it's passed to the AutoGen agent
4. If the input is blocked, a blocked message is returned
5. The response from the AutoGen agent is returned to the user

This architecture allows for:

- Different types of superego agents (input, output, etc.)
- Different constitutions for different use cases
- Different flows for different applications

## Testing

The system can be tested using the CLI:

- `python backend/run_cli.py autogen`: Test the AutoGen agent
- `python backend/run_cli.py superego`: Test the InputSuperego agent
- `python backend/run_cli.py flow`: Test the SuperegoFlow

Each command supports additional arguments:

- `--system-prompt`: Set the system prompt for the AutoGen agent
- `--constitution`: Set the constitution for the InputSuperego agent

## Frontend Integration Handover

### Key Changes for Frontend Developers

1. **Constitution System Changes**:
   - Constitutions are now stored as individual markdown files in `backend/app/data/constitutions/`
   - Each constitution file has a name (first line with `# Name`) and content
   - The constitution ID is the filename without the `.md` extension
   - The constitution registry loads all constitutions from this directory

2. **Agent Instructions System**:
   - Agent instructions are now separate from constitutions
   - Instructions are stored in `backend/app/data/agent_instructions/`
   - Each agent type has its own instructions file (e.g., `input_superego.md`)
   - The system combines instructions and constitutions when creating agents

3. **API Changes**:
   - The `/constitutions` endpoint should now return a list of available constitutions with their IDs and names
   - The frontend should allow users to select a constitution by ID
   - When creating a flow, the frontend should pass the selected constitution ID to the backend

4. **UI Considerations**:
   - The ConstitutionSelector component should be updated to fetch and display constitutions from the new endpoint
   - Consider adding a preview feature to show the content of a constitution before selecting it
   - The SuperegoEvaluationBox component should continue to work as before, as the evaluation format hasn't changed

5. **WebSocket Changes**:
   - The WebSocket endpoints need to be updated to support the new constitution system
   - Messages should include the constitution ID when creating a flow
   - The frontend should handle any new message types or fields related to constitutions

6. **Testing**:
   - Test the frontend with different constitutions to ensure it works correctly
   - Verify that the constitution selector displays all available constitutions
   - Check that the selected constitution is correctly passed to the backend
