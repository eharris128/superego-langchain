# API Refactoring Progress

**Note: The original API refactoring plan has been incorporated into the new [Focused Improvement Plan](improvement_plan.md).**

This document is kept for historical reference. Please refer to the new improvement plan for the current approach to improving the codebase.

## Completed Work

The following API-related improvements have been completed so far:

1. **Backend API Structure**
   - Created API package structure with proper organization
   - Implemented utility functions for API responses and error handling
   - Created REST API endpoints for constitutions, system prompts, flow templates, configs, and instances
   - Added proper error handling and status codes

2. **JSON Serialization Improvements**
   - Added proper JSON serialization for Pydantic models
   - Implemented custom JSON encoder for objects that aren't natively JSON serializable
   - Updated flow_manager.py to use the custom JSON encoder

3. **Frontend API Client**
   - Created a simplified REST API client using Axios
   - Implemented React Query hooks for data fetching and caching
   - Updated ConstitutionManager component to use React Query hooks
   - Set up QueryClientProvider in main.tsx

This foundation will be built upon according to the new [Focused Improvement Plan](improvement_plan.md), particularly the sections on WebSocket Handler Refactoring and Frontend-Backend Message Alignment.
