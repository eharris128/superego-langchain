# WebSocket to REST API Migration Progress

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Backend REST API Development

1. ✅ **Created Conversations API**
   - Created a new file `backend/app/api/conversations.py` with endpoints for:
     - Getting all conversations with pagination
     - Getting conversation history by ID with pagination
     - Creating new conversations
     - Updating conversation messages
     - Deleting conversations
   - Added the conversations router to `backend/app/api/router.py`

### Phase 2: Frontend REST Client Updates

1. ✅ **Added Conversations API Client**
   - Updated `frontend/src/api/restClient.ts` to add methods for:
     - Getting all conversations with pagination
     - Getting conversation history by ID with pagination
     - Creating new conversations
     - Updating conversations
     - Deleting conversations

2. ✅ **Added React Query Hooks for Conversations**
   - Updated `frontend/src/api/queryHooks.ts` to add hooks for:
     - Fetching all conversations
     - Fetching conversation history
     - Creating conversations
     - Updating conversations
     - Deleting conversations

### Phase 3: Component Updates

1. ✅ **Updated Chat Component**
   - Modified `frontend/src/components/Chat.tsx` to:
     - Use REST API for fetching conversation history
     - Use REST API for updating conversations
     - Keep WebSockets only for real-time message streaming

2. ✅ **Updated InstanceSidebar Component**
   - Modified `frontend/src/components/InstanceSidebar.tsx` to:
     - Make props optional since it's using React Query hooks
     - Use React Query hooks exclusively for data fetching
   - Updated `frontend/src/App.tsx` to:
     - Remove WebSocket-based data fetching for flow instances and configs
     - Use React Query hooks for flow instances and configs
     - Remove unnecessary props passed to InstanceSidebar

## Pending Tasks

### Phase 3: Component Updates (Continued)

2. ✅ **ConstitutionManager Component**
   - Verified that `frontend/src/components/ConstitutionManager.tsx` already uses REST API for:
     - Fetching constitutions
     - Creating/updating/deleting constitutions

3. ✅ **SyspromptSelector Component**
   - Verified that `frontend/src/components/SyspromptSelector.tsx` already indirectly uses REST API:
     - It receives system prompts data from parent components
     - The Chat component uses the useSysprompts hook to fetch system prompts from the REST API
     - The MessageBubble component passes this data to SyspromptSelector

4. ✅ **ParallelFlowsView Component**
   - Verified that `frontend/src/components/ParallelFlowsView.tsx` already:
     - Uses REST API (useFlowConfigs hook) for fetching flow configs
     - Uses WebSockets only for real-time operations (running parallel flows and streaming tokens)

### Phase 4: WebSocket Client Simplification

1. ✅ **Simplified WebSocketClient**
   - Updated `frontend/src/api/websocketClient.ts` to:
     - Removed `requestConversationHistory` method
     - Removed `onConversationUpdate` callback
     - Removed handling of non-real-time message types
     - Focused exclusively on real-time streaming operations

2. ✅ **Updated WebSocket Message Handlers**
   - Created a simplified version of the WebSocket endpoints in `backend/app/websocket_endpoints_simplified.py` that:
     - Keeps only handlers for real-time operations (user_message, rerun_message, rerun_from_constitution, run_parallel_flows)
     - Removes handlers for operations migrated to REST API (get_constitutions, get_system_prompts, get_flow_templates, etc.)
     - Uses the conversation_manager.get_conversation() function to fetch conversation history from persistent storage
   - Created a simplified version of the main application in `backend/app/main_simplified.py` that:
     - Uses the simplified WebSocket endpoints directly
     - Keeps all the REST API endpoints
   - Created a script to run the simplified version of the application in `backend/run_simplified.py`

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation (Pending)

1. **Test REST API Endpoints**
   - Test each new and existing REST endpoint
   - Verify correct data retrieval, updates, and error handling

2. **Test Frontend Components**
   - Test each updated component
   - Verify they correctly use REST APIs for non-real-time operations
   - Verify they still use WebSockets for real-time operations

3. **Test End-to-End Functionality**
   - Test switching between conversations
   - Verify messages are properly persisted
   - Test rerunning messages with different constitutions

## Next Steps

1. Run the simplified application using `backend/run_simplified.py`
2. Test the application to verify that the migration was successful
3. If all tests pass, replace the original files with the simplified versions
