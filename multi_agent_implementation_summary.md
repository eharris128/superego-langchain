# Multi-Agent Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a robust multi-agent system using LangGraph's Command-based flow control. The system consists of:

1. An Input Superego agent that evaluates user inputs against a constitution
2. An Assistant agent that can use tools (like a calculator)
3. A flow system that routes between these agents based on the evaluation results

## Key Components

### 1. Command-Based Flow Control

We use LangGraph's Command objects to explicitly control the flow between agents. This allows agents to decide where to route next based on their processing results.

```python
# Example of a Command object
Command(
    goto="assistant",  # Where to go next
    update={           # State updates
        "superego_evaluation": evaluation
    }
)
```

### 2. Input Superego Agent

The Input Superego agent evaluates user inputs against a constitution and returns a Command object to route the flow based on the evaluation result.

- If the input is allowed, it routes to the Assistant agent
- If the input is blocked, it routes to END
- If the input requires caution, it routes to the Assistant agent with a caution message

### 3. Assistant Agent with Tool Support

The Assistant agent can use tools to help generate responses. Currently, it supports a calculator tool.

- The Assistant agent can detect when a user is asking for a calculation
- It extracts the expression and uses the calculator tool to compute the result
- It formats the response with the calculation result

### 4. Calculator Tool

A simple calculator tool that can evaluate mathematical expressions.

## Flow Process

1. User sends a message
2. The Input Superego agent evaluates the message against the constitution
3. Based on the evaluation:
   - If BLOCKED: Return a blocked message to the user
   - If ALLOWED or CAUTION: Route to the Assistant agent
4. The Assistant agent processes the message:
   - If it's a calculation request, it uses the calculator tool
   - Otherwise, it generates a normal response
5. The response is returned to the user

## Error Handling

- No silent fallbacks: If a constitution is not found, the system raises an error
- Tool errors are properly handled and reported to the user
- Exceptions during processing are caught and reported

## Future Improvements

1. Add more tools to the Assistant agent
2. Implement more sophisticated agent types (e.g., Researcher, Router)
3. Add support for parallel agent execution
4. Implement a more sophisticated Input Superego agent that uses an LLM for evaluation
5. Add support for conversation history and context management
